# updatedTika
This code will go throught unknown file types.('application/octet-stream') With updated mimetype repository it is able to detect file types with slightly better accuracy. 


This code needs MongoDB access. You should give URI to a MongoDB at : 
static final String mongoURL = "mongodb://****

New mime repo is also included that should be added to the tika library used in compile time.
